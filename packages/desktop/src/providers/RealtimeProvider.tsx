/**
 * Responsibility: provide real time feel of people presence
 *
 * Get to know when:
 * - me or someone else tunes or untunes from a conversation
 * - someone speaks in a chat for a conversation that I am tuned into
 * - there is new content in a channel that I am connected or tuned into
 * - someone in a chat that I am tuned into goes into flow state
 *
 *
 * Firing Events - this could be in the universe as a whole through a hook and doesn't need to be in here
 * - have helper async functions which take in a socket client and call the event
 * - on load, we need to join the particular rooms based on priority vs inbox
 * - move conversation to priority and back and mutate the conversation map
 *
 * Listening Events:
 * - have a useEffect that listens to all events and mutates conversation map accordingly
 * -
